## Styled Components with Emotion
In `./Common` we have a collection of shared components used throughout this project.
We use [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) for our styles.

From the docs: 

```
Emotion is a library designed for writing css styles with JavaScript. It provides powerful and predictable style composition in addition to a great developer experience with features such as source maps, labels, and testing utilities. Both string and object styles are supported.
```
